# Crop_Price_Predictor_Using-Random-Forest-Supervised-Machine-Learning-

*Introduction -
This system uses machine learning to forecast the prices of agricultural commodities, which are important for food security, farmersâ€™ profitability, and informed decision-making by farmers and industry stakeholders. The system predicts the prices based on weather conditions and historical data, such as modal, maximum and minimum prices, productivity, production, rainfall, and temperature. The system uses data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms, such as random forest and decision trees, to analyze the effect of weather factors on price changes. The system shows accurate and precise agricultural prices and proves that random forest has better predictive power than decision trees. This system helps farmers and the agricultural sector to make secure decisions and cope with price volatility in a world where food production and economic sustainability depend on price predictability. This system is a practical and powerful tool for improving the prediction of the agricultural sector.
The system also offers a platform where farmers can view the crop sowing trends in different regions and decide which crop will give them maximum benefits. We provide a basic overview of the current crop sowing data, which shows which crops are planted by other farmers in which regions. This helps the farmers avoid low prices due to excessive crop production and serves as a crop sowing guide.

*System Architecture -

Input fom user ===>>  1. Commodity name
                      2. Current month and year
                      3. Rainfall

Output        ===>>   Predict commodity Price of future months
                      predict commodity price of next year also
